        <p>The Digital Drawing Canvas is a basic painting tool. This project was started for the purpose of practicing design patterns and software tools. Because it was started for this reason, the project may not reach a state for public distribution.</p>

        <p>The drawing functionality of the project is nearly complete. The shape attributes and selections have all been completed and require no further additions. The final additions needed to be made are to limit the drawing area to a section of the canvas and change the background color of the drawing area to white.</p>
        <p>Some features that still need implementation are the functionality to save the image and ability to erase drawn images.</p>

        <p><b>Observer:</b> This pattern is applied to the drawing functionality and the color box. When the size and RGB silders are adjusted, the shape attributes and color box will receive a notification and update their information accordingly to the new adjusted value.</p>
        <p><b>State:</b> This pattern is applied on the logic for switching between different shapes. When a new shape is selected, the variable containing the current shape changes its instance to the appropiate one.</p>

        <p>Working on this project demonstrated to me that the diffculty of designing software is not achieving a functionality but the method used to achieve a fucntionality. Enabling the project to draw and adjust shape attributes was fairly simple, but the method I used could be reworked to follow a better design.</p>
